# Workshop:  Integrate the AWS Cloud with Responsive Xilinx Machine Learning at the Edge


In this workshop, learn how you can integrate Xilinx edge machine learning with massive scale AWS Cloud analytics, machine learning model building, and dashboards.  Based on an Oil & Gas scenario, you will learn how to combine AWS Cloud services with AWS Greengrass on Zynq Ultrascale+ and Amazon FreeRTOS on Xilinx Zynq-7000.  After this workshop, you will have a concrete understanding of Machine Learning applicability at the edge and its relationship with the AWS Cloud.

# Lab 1: Setup the Environment

Time to completion: 20 minutes

In this lab you will download the Xilinx tools required for customizing the runtime images of the embedded platforms and set-up your corresponding cloud environment.
